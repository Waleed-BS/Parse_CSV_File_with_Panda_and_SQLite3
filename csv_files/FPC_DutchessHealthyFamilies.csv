Services include helping families access community resources and services, educating families on parenting and child development, connecting families with medical providers, and assessing children for developmental delays.
The Maternal and Infant Health Collaborative (MICHC) seeks to improve maternal and infant health outcomes for high-need women of childbearing age and their families, while reducing racial, ethnic and economic disparities in those outcomes. High-need women include those who are low-income or uninsured; racial, ethnic and linguistic minorities; women with multiple social or economic stressors; underserved immigrants; victims of domestic violence; individuals impacted by mental health issues, alcoholism and/or substance abuse; women with unintended or unwanted pregnancies; and women with disabilities. These women on average attend fewer prenatal visits and are more likely to experience poorer pregnancy outcomes. Their families are more likely to be without a medical home and are less likely to access consistent, comprehensive preventive and primary care services.
The Institute for Family Health is a private, non-profit federally qualified community health center (FQHC) with an outstanding reputation for high-quality health services. The Institute provides high-quality, culturally competent and affordable primary health services to medically underserved populations in three service area regions of New York State: the Bronx, Manhattan (both in New York City) and the Mid-Hudson Valley, located approximately 90 miles north of New York City. In addition to its health centers, the Institute operates an array of training, community outreach and social service programs designed to meet the healthcare and workforce development needs of medically underserved communities.
